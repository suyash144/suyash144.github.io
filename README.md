I am currently a Research Software Engineer at the Cortex Lab, UCL Queen Square Institute of Neurology.

Before that, I completed my MEng degree at Oxford University. You can find my LinkedIn [here](https://www.linkedin.com/in/suyash--agarwal/). 

Broadly, I am interested in machine learning and neuroscience. In my degree, I also really enjoyed studying and researching the following: computer vision, robotics, control theory, optimisation and bioinformatics.
