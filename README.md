I am currently a Research Software Engineer at Cortexlab, UCL Queen Square Institute of Neurology. 

I work on machine learning and AI methods for neural data analysis with Prof. Kenneth Harris. Some recent projects include:

- DeepUnitMatch: a neural network method for tracking neurons via their electrophysiological spike waveforms. This uses contrastive learning and a spatio-temporal autoencoder architecture to beat current state-of-the-art methods. We are in the process of writing this up!
- Alfred: an LLM-powered tool for automatic data analysis, used by scientists at Cortexlab, Google DeepMind and the International Brain Lab. If you have an API key from Google, Anthropic or OpenAI, you can try it out [here](https://alfred-g6uv.onrender.com/).

  I am the sole developer on this project, built using Python and Flask for the backend and React and NodeJS for the frontend. The currently supported LLMs are Gemini 2.5 Pro, Claude 3.7 Sonnet, GPT-4.1 and o1.
- Bayesian Radar Cosplace: my Masters' research project at the Oxford Robotics Institute, masterfully supervised by Matt Gadd and Paul Newman. We published an article on the project [here](https://doi.org/10.1049/rsn2.70002).

I am also doing some work with the Visual Geometry Group at Oxford, where my focus is on improving transformer efficiency for video generation.

Before moving to London, I was at Oxford University for 4 years studying for my MEng degree, and I have worked at the Computer Vision Lab at ETH Zurich. 

Broadly, I am interested in machine learning and computational neuroscience but I have also studied computer vision, robotics, control theory, optimisation and bioinformatics. I am always interested in exploring these fields further.
