I am currently a Research Software Engineer at the Cortexlab, UCL Queen Square Institute of Neurology. I work with Prof. Kenneth Harris, with the aim of understanding how neuron populations process sensory information to inform decision-making in the brain.

Prior to this, I completed my MEng Engineering Science degree at Oxford University. You can find my LinkedIn [here](https://www.linkedin.com/in/suyash--agarwal/). 

Broadly, I am interested in machine learning and neuroscience. In my degree, I also really enjoyed studying and researching the following: computer vision, robotics, control theory, optimisation and bioinformatics. I am always interested in exploring these fields further.
