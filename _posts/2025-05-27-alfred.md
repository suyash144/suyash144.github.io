## ALFRED

Last week, I released an LLM-powered tool for automatic data analysis called Alfred. You can upload data to Alfred and the tool will do the following:
- generate some possible analysis steps to help you understand the data better
- generate some Python code that executes these analyses and produces some figures / text output
- run this code on your data in a sandboxed Python environment
- interpret the results of the analysis, update its understanding of your data and propose steps for further analysis
all in one click!

If you're interested in trying it out, you can do so [here](https://alfred-g6uv.onrender.com/). This doesn't require any computing power or setup. All you need is an API key for [Claude](https://docs.anthropic.com/en/docs/get-started), [Gemini](https://aistudio.google.com/app/apikey) or an [OpenAI](https://platform.openai.com/docs/quickstart/step-2-set-up-your-api-key?api-mode=responses) model (e.g. GPT-4.1 or o1). If you don't already have one, you can generate one by clicking on the links. Gemini is currently free to use via the API but it has a strictly limited token rate so you may not get much usage out of it! The others charge a very small amount per token.

Read on for more instructions on using Alfred!
