I am currently a Research Software Engineer at Cortexlab, UCL Queen Square Institute of Neurology.

I work on machine learning and AI methods for computational neuroscience with Prof. Kenneth Harris.

Before moving to London, I was at Oxford University for 4 years studying for my MEng degree. During this time, I spent a summer at the Computer Vision Lab at ETH Zurich.

Broadly, I am interested in machine learning and computational neuroscience but I have also studied signal processing, control theory, optimisation and bioinformatics. I am always interested in exploring these fields further.

Outside of work, you'll find me on the tennis court or climbing!
