## Current and Recent Projects

### DeepUnitMatch
A neural network method for tracking neurons via their electrophysiological spike waveforms. This uses contrastive learning and a spatio-temporal autoencoder architecture to beat current state-of-the-art methods. We are in the process of writing this up!

### Alfred
An LLM-powered tool for automatic data analysis, used by scientists at Cortexlab, Google DeepMind and the International Brain Lab. If you have an API key from Google, Anthropic or OpenAI, you can try it out [here](https://alfred-g6uv.onrender.com/).

I am the sole developer on this project, built using Python and Flask for the backend and React and NodeJS for the frontend. The currently supported LLMs are Gemini 2.5 Pro, Claude 3.7 Sonnet, GPT-4.1 and o1.

### Other Work
I am also doing some work with the Visual Geometry Group (VGG) at Oxford, where my focus is on improving transformer efficiency for video generation.

### Bayesian Radar Cosplace
My Masters' research project at the Oxford Robotics Institute, skillfully supervised by Matt Gadd and Paul Newman. We published an article on the project [here](https://doi.org/10.1049/rsn2.70002).
